This package provides common data structures used by all Lezer-related
parsingâ€”those related to syntax trees and the generic interface of
parsers. Their main use is the [LR](#lr) parsers generated by the
[parser generator](#generator), but for example the [Markdown
parser](https://github.com/lezer-parser/markdown) implements a
different parsing algorithm using the same interfaces.

### Trees

Lezer syntax trees are _not_ abstract, they just tell you which nodes
were parsed where, without providing additional information about
their role or relation (beyond parent-child relations). This makes
them rather unsuited for some purposes, but quick to construct and
cheap to store.

#### Buffers

Buffers are an optimization in the way Lezer trees are stored.

### Incremental Parsing

Efficient reparsing happens by reusing parts of the original parsed
structure. This data structure tracks trees from previous parses along
with some metadata that tells us which parts can be safely reused.
